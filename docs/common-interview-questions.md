# Common Interview Questions

Over the years I've interviewed over 100 candidates for roles.  With the constant technology change it is impossible for any developer to know everything. A solid developers can learn whatever you want them to do quickly so it is pretty important that you concentrate on the main general questions. It will be impossible for you to learn every single question that might get thrown at you in a job interview.  

A lot of interviewers are more interested in seeing how you think through problems. Half the items on this list are admittedly. NET trivia questions. If you know all the answers forward and backward you are a better developer than I am.

I’ve found that before interviews if I run through a sample of the main concepts it has always helped give me an edge. 

#### BEING PREPARED FOR AN INTERVIEW IS KEY TO NAILING IT

Obviosuly, it is impossible to know the answers to every question you might get asked, so chill.  

Before any interview, go on their website, and read what they do, find one thing you like about their website and one thing you dislike.  This should be more than enough.  Whaterver you don't, don't pretend that you've looked at a site when you havn't.  If you get found out, you'll get an instant no.  

#### TREAT AN INTERVIEW LIKE A CHAT, DON’T SWEAT IT. THE INTERVIEWERS ARE PEOPLE TOO

The key to technical interview is having solid soft skills, so good knowledge about design princples like OO, functional programming, TDD, dependency injection etc..  Having experience with more than one language and an all round general smartness.
