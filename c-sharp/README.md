# C# Job Interview Questions

As a contractor, I frequently have to do interviews, so I thought it's about time I listed all the resources I use when I'm doing preparation. The best resource I've found is an online test that presents you 10 random .net multiple questions. It definitely helps jog the memory banks before an interview 

Below lists a bunch of questions I've picked up from all over the web.  I have lost references to each source.
